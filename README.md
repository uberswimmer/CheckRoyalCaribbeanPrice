# CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice
Checks if you have the cheapest price for your **Royal Caribbean** and **Celebrity Cruises** purchases (beverage packages, excursions, internet, etc.).  Not affiliated with Royal Caribbean Group in any way. 
- ✅ Automatically checks your purchased packages (no need to enter them manually)  
- ✅ Alerts you if a lower price is available (email, ntfy, Home Assistant, etc) 
- ✅ Finds deals specific to each passenger (loyalty or casino status, age-based or room specials) where other "royal price trackers" only find publicly available (often higher) prices
- ✅ Shows currently assigned cabin in Royal's backend system (*likely* the room you will get if purchased a GTY "We choose your room")
- ✅ Shows the payment balance Royal's backend system thinks they are owed (does not include TA's take!) and estimated final payment date
- ✅ Supports multiple Royal and Celebrity accounts or linked cruises
- ✅ Handles all currencies (checks each item based on the currency used to purchase it)
- ✅ Can automatically check **cabin prices** for any cruise you booked, using loyalty/senior/resident discounts
- ✅ Can create a "watchlist" to check prices of items you have not purchased (thanks @jhedlund)  
- ✅ Can also watchlist **cabin prices** with just a booking URL (no login required, supports discounts)  
- ✅ Can display active sitewide promotions (flash sales, percentage-off deals) for each sailing
- ✅ Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker, iOS, Android, and Home Assistant. Also a vibe-coded Android App and Greasemonkey script
- ✅ Completely open source, free to use or modify.
- ✅ Separate `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` script lets you look up any cruise's addon prices, cabin prices, onboard activity schedule, MDR menus, and dress codes. No setup/account required! Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker, iOS, Android. Also made a vibe-coded Android App and a Web-based version.
   

> ⚠️ This is **not a hack**. All API calls and data are publicly available. The script simply automates what you can do on the Royal Caribbean website.

If the code saved you money or correctly predicted your cabin number, please star the repo or post on your favorite cruise board.
