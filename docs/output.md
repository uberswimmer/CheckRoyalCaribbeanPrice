[Back to README](../README.md)

With [`scheduledActivities`](scheduled-activities.md) configured, a separate
**Scheduled Activities & Reservations** section follows the price and check-in
summaries. It groups already-booked activities by sailing, in date/time order,
with participating guests and locations. Failed refreshes retain and label the
last successful snapshot **STALE**, rather than reporting a canceled or empty
schedule. This is not the public onboard activity schedule in the Browse script.

If any of the prices are lower, it will send a notification if you set up apprise. Notification will include a link to your order history and the specific date and order number to cancel. Notice on the 2nd reservation, the official room is GTY but the excursions show the currently assigned room in the Royal backend system. This room is likely what you will get!

At the end of the run, a summary table shows the check-in opening/boarding time and final payment date for every booked sailing, sorted by sail date. The final payment column is color coded: green if paid in full, yellow if a balance is still due (or the API does not report a status, common for travel agent bookings - see reservationsPaidInFull above), and red if a balance is due past the final payment date.
