## Get Cruise URL for Watchlist Functionality (Optional - This is only for a cruise you have not booked!)
1. If you want to check the cabin price of a cruise you have booked, see [Edit Config File](config.md). This section is just for cruises you have *not* booked yet.
1. Be sure you are logged out of the Royal Caribbean / Celebrity Website. If you are logged in, the URL you get in Step 5 will not work.
1. Go to Royal Caribbean or Celebrity and do a mock booking of the room you want, with the same number of adults and kids
1. Select a cruise and select your room type/room. Be sure to enter your C&A number and any senior/military/police discounts in the "Apply Promo Code and Exclusive Rates" link to the left. **Use your C&A or Celebrity # depending on the cruise. Do not use username. Bug in Royal Website requires your number not username**
1. If you want a refundable deposit, trip insurance, included gratituies, or Celebrity only All-In package be sure to select them on the "preferences screen"
1. If you have a coupon code (e.g dp340 for Diamond Plus 340+ on a solo booking), be sure to enter it.
1. Complete until they ask for your personal/guest information
1. At this point, you should see a blue bar at the bottom right of webpage with a price
1. Copy the entire URL from the top of your browser into the cruiseURL field. The url should start with `https://www.royalcaribbean.com/checkout/guest-info?...` or `https://www.celebritycruises.com/checkout/guest-info?...` where `...` is a bunch of stuff. Copy the entire URL
1. Put the price you paid in the paidPrice field. Remove the `$` and any `,` . Subtract any OBC you recieved from Royal or your TA. Do not add letters in this price, the code can tell from the URL if you included gratities, All-In package, etc.
1. Run the tool and see if it works
1. You can add multiple cruiseURL/paidPrice to track multiple cruises or rooms on a cruise
1. If the code says the price is cheaper, do a mock booking to see if cabin is still available. You need to do this from a new search on the Royal Caribbean / Celebrity website. Do not just put the cruiseURL in your browser.
1. If it is lower than you paid for and before final payment date call your Travel Agent or Royal Caribbean (if you booked direct) and they should (reports of pushback lately) reduce the price. Be careful, you will lose the onboard credit you got in your first booking, if the new booking does not still offer it! The code will print the OBC offered for the new cruise, but will not subtract it because OBC only given in USD
1. Update the paidPrice field to the new price. Remove the `$` ,`£` and any `,` (or `.` if non-USD currency for thousands designator)
1. If there are no more rooms of the same class available to book, you will not be able to reprice. You will need to wait until a room opens up. The code will print the cheapest interior, outside view, balcony or suite available. These are probably GTY for each class and not the exact type of room you wanted. This is all the public cruise price API returns.
1. If you only want to check the cruise prices with URL you provide, you do not need to have your `accountInfo` and/or `apprise` in your [config file](config.md), as they are not necessary.
1. Should always give price in your current currency (except for OBC which is only in USD). If your currency is not supported, create an issue

## Notify when a cabin becomes available

Set `notificationMode: availability` on an individual entry in `cruises` to receive
an alert when its cabin subtype becomes available. Keep using the complete checkout
URL for the desired sailing, cabin and passenger counts:

```yaml
cruises:
  - cruiseURL: "YOUR_COMPLETE_CHECKOUT_URL"
    notificationMode: availability

cabinAvailabilityStateFile: /app/data/cabin-availability.json
```

This mode does not require `paidPrice` and does not apply `minimumSavingAlert`.
It sends one **Cruise Room Available** alert, with the current price when returned
and a booking link. It also alerts if the first successful check finds availability.
An unavailable result appears in the console/report without sending a notification.
A subsequent confirmed closure rearms the alert for the next reopening. It tracks
subtype inventory, not a particular cabin number; confirm the booking on Royal's site.
If the inventory row describes a different lead-in category, checkout must return
a fare for the requested category before an alert can be sent. Missing or invalid
counts are also uncertain until checkout confirms a fare. Ordinary price checks
continue to attempt checkout for matching subtypes regardless of lead-in stock.
Guarantee categories require a returned fare because the inventory endpoint does not
identify them individually.

State persists across scheduled runs and container restarts. Mount `/app/data` as a
writable persistent volume in Docker. Outside Docker the default state path is
`data/cabin-availability.json`, relative to the working directory. This separate
JSON file holds only the latest state per search, not a report history. The YAML
configuration is never rewritten. Changing search criteria creates a new watch
state. Each entry has this shape (the actual key is the normalized search criteria
serialized as a JSON string, including overrides, so different searches using one
URL stay separate):

```json
{
  "SEARCH_KEY": {
    "url": "YOUR_COMPLETE_CHECKOUT_URL",
    "available": true,
    "notified": true
  }
}
```

To test or reset a watch, stop checks first and locate its `url` in the state file.
Set `notified` to `false` to allow another alert on the next confirmed available
result, or delete that entry to reset it. Delete the file (or replace its contents
with `{}`) to reset all watches. Keep Boolean values as `true`/`false`, not strings.
`available` records the last confirmed result; `notified` records successful
delivery for the current opening. An unavailable watch must have `notified: false`.
Protect this file like your configuration: checkout URLs and search keys may
contain loyalty numbers. Do not commit or publish it.

Earlier JSON revisions of this PR used hashed search keys. Those entries are not
automatically migrated to the readable keys, so each available watch may send one
new initial alert after upgrading. While checks are stopped, old hashed entries
can be removed; subsequent runs use the readable keys.

Writes replace the file atomically, and a sibling `.lock` file prevents overlapping
processes from reading/notifying/updating the same state concurrently. Leave that
lock file in place; its existence does not mean a check is running. The operating
system releases its lock if the process exits. A busy lock skips the affected watch
with a partial-failure status so it can retry on the next run. Use a local filesystem
with working file locks and mount the whole data directory, not just the JSON file.
Malformed or unreadable existing state is reported, never silently reset. A crash
after notification delivery but before saving can still cause a repeated alert.

If testing an earlier revision of this PR that used SQLite, change any explicit
`cabinAvailabilityStateFile` to a new `.json` path. The old database is left untouched
and is not automatically imported; the fresh state can send one initial alert for
each available watch. Do not simply rename the SQLite database to `.json`. This
change does not affect the existing optional SQLite price-history feature.

Configure Apprise to deliver alerts. Failed deliveries remain pending for retry;
failed or unrecognized API responses retain the previous state.
Without Apprise, availability is reported in the console without treating it as
a delivery failure or marking an alert delivered. Adding Apprise later allows an
available cabin to trigger its first notification.

A notification or state-storage failure affects only that watch. Remaining
watches and the summary report still run; the process records a partial failure
and exits with the existing partial-failure status. A missing inventory array or
an incomplete response cannot rearm an alert. Explicit empty inventory arrays
confirm closure; unrelated malformed rows do not invalidate a usable match.

An omitted, empty or null `cruises` section disables prospective watches.

Omit `notificationMode`, or set it to `price`, to keep existing price-watch behavior,
including its required `paidPrice`. Availability mode uses the regular check schedule.
